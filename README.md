This a set of small set "environments" for testing AI Agents to work out challenging problems encountered in my workflow.

Goals for setting this is mostly for:
    - Testing and compare capability for AI agents, primarily CLI agents with tool use capabilities.
    - Figuring out prompt engineering best practices.
    - Developing new agents and/or reasoning traces.
