This a set of small set "environments" for testing AI Agents to work out challenging problems encountered in my workflow.

## Goals

- Testing and compare capability for AI agents, primarily CLI agents with tool use capabilities.
- Figuring out prompt engineering best practices.
- Developing new agents and/or reasoning traces.

## Structure

Each folder under `env/` contains a small environment with necessary files for problem setup.
The `prompt.txt` contains expected prompt to fed to CLI agent.
Some environments may have specialized dependencies. Dependency setup script will be added in future.
